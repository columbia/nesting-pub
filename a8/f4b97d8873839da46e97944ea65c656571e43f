v1-->v2:
Added Linaro in the copyright.
Allowed to inject exceptions while the current exception level is virtual EL2.
Move the irq injection function to a later patch.
Rewrote the comment message.

TODO:
We can change the file name to something like inject_exceptions_nested.c
We can possibly create an unified get_except_vector
