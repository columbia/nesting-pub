v1-->v2:
Allowed to inject exceptions while the current exception level is virtual EL2.
Moved code to inject irqs to a later patch.
Added Linaro in the copyright.

This commit can be improved by creating an unified function to get the
exception vector regardless of the target exception level. This function
can be reused in inject_fault.c
