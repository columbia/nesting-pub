v1-->v2:
Allowed to inject exceptions while the current exception level is virtual EL2.
Moved the code to inject irqs to a later patch.
Added Linaro in the copyright.
Rewrote the comment message.

This commit can be improved by creating an unified function to get the
exception vector regardless of the target exception level and reuse it in
inject_fault.c
